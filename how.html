<p>
    After you authorize EventBot to access your Google Calendar
    account, EventBot will create a unique, unguessable email address
    for you (something like IW8VNVdWxg@myeventbot.appspotmail.com).
</p>
<p>
    Remember this address (by adding it to your address book or
    contacts in your email program, for example).  Any time you send
    an email to this address, EventBot will try to interpret the
    subject line as an event description and create that event in your
    Google Calendar.
</p>
<p>
    EventBot never knows your Google Calendar username and password.
    All we store is a "token" from Google that can be used to create
    events on your calendar.  EventBot will never use this token
    except in response to emails you send to your personal EventBot
    address.  You can also revoke this token at any time (for example
    if someone else gets hold of your personal EventBot address, or
    you want to stop using EventBot) from
    your <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/IssuedAuthSubTokens">Google
    Account</a> page.
