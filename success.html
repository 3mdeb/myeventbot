  <p>
      Your EventBot email address has been created!  You can add
      events to your Google Calendar by sending an email
      to <a href="mailto:{{email_address}}">{{email_address}}</a>.  Be
      sure to keep this address a secret &mdash; anyone who knows it
      can use it to create events in your calendar.
  </p>
  <p>
      Put your event description in the subject line in plain English, e.g., "Lunch with Bob Friday 12:30".
      The event description can contain anything supported by Google
      Calendar's <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=36604">Quick
      Add</a> feature.
  </p>
  <p>
      Right now the body of your email is ignored.  We plan to add
      more capabilities to EventBot over time, so
      follow <a href="http://twitter.com/myeventbot">@myeventbot</a>
      on Twitter to see what's new or send us your suggestions.
